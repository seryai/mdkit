# Changelog

All notable changes to mdkit are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and mdkit
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

mdkit is pre-1.0 — the public API surface (`Extractor`, `Engine`,
`Document`, `Error`) is intended to stay stable, but minor versions
may introduce additive changes to backends, feature flags, and
auxiliary types until 1.0 lands.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Mixed-content PDF OCR.** v0.5.0–v0.5.4 only triggered the OCR
  fallback when the *whole* PDF returned empty text. Real-world PDFs
  often mix text-bearing and scanned pages — a text body with a
  scanned cover page, a mostly-scanned doc with a couple of typed
  pages, etc. v0.5.5 switches to **per-page detection**: pages whose
  pdfium text extraction comes back empty get rendered + OCR'd
  individually, pages with text pass through unchanged.
- **`PdfiumExtractor::render_pages_subset_to_pngs(path, indices,
  out_dir)`** — render only the listed page indices (0-based) to
  PNGs, sorted+deduped internally so output order is predictable
  ascending-by-page-number. Used by the per-page OCR path so we
  don't burn render time on pages that already have clean text.
- New extracted-`Document` metadata key `pages_ocred` reports the
  count of pages that went through OCR (1+ for mixed-content,
  total-page-count for fully-scanned, absent for pure-text PDFs).

### Changed

- **`## Page N` heading layout activation rule.** Whenever any page
  went through OCR (mixed-content or fully-scanned), the output is
  now per-page-headed so OCR'd pages are visually distinguishable
  and downstream readers can cite by page. Pure text-only PDFs keep
  the simpler blank-line-between-pages layout that v0.2–v0.5.4 used,
  preserving backward compat for callers whose snapshots / tests pin
  that shape.
- The internal `PdfiumExtractor::extract_via_ocr` fold-everything-into-
  OCR helper from v0.5.3 has been removed. Its behavior is now
  subsumed by the new per-page logic in `extract` (a fully-scanned
  PDF has all pages flagged empty and follows the same path).
  Externally observable behavior is unchanged for fully-scanned PDFs.

### Notes

- New ignored test `mixed_content_pdf_ocrs_only_empty_pages`
  validates the contract end-to-end. Run with:
  `cargo test --features "pdf ocr-platform" -- --ignored
  mixed_content_pdf_ocrs_only_empty_pages` after dropping a 2+ page
  PDF with at least one text page and at least one scanned page at
  `tests/fixtures/mixed-content.pdf`.
- The detection threshold remains `text.trim().is_empty()` per page.
  Pages with even a single non-whitespace character are treated as
  text-bearing — partial OCR-overlay (e.g. mixing pdfium text with
  OCR'd text on the same page) is intentionally not done, since it
  tends to produce duplicate or garbled output.

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **PDF document metadata extraction** (deferred since v0.2).
  `PdfiumExtractor` now reads the PDF document-information dictionary
  (`/Title /Author /Subject /Keywords /Creator /Producer /CreationDate
  /ModDate`, per ISO 32000-2 §14.3.3) and surfaces it on the returned
  `Document`:
  - `Document.title` is populated from `/Title` when present.
  - `Document.metadata` carries the full set under stable lowercase
    keys: `title`, `author`, `subject`, `keywords`, `creator`,
    `producer`, `created_at`, `modified_at`. (`title` mirrors
    `Document.title` so callers consuming metadata uniformly don't
    have to special-case it.)
  - Tags with empty values are skipped, so callers don't have to
    distinguish "absent" from "present-but-empty."
  - Date values are passed through verbatim — Pdfium hands us PDF-spec
    date strings (e.g. `D:20240115120000Z`) and parsing them into
    RFC 3339 stays out of scope for the extractor surface; downstream
    code that cares can parse `metadata["created_at"]` itself.
- **Metadata + title survive the OCR fallback path.** Scanned PDFs
  often have populated `/Info` dicts even when `/Contents` is
  image-only — the v0.5.3 fallback dropped both. v0.5.4 merges
  pdfium-extracted metadata + title into the OCR-result `Document`,
  with `extractor_chain` and `pages_ocred` added on top.

### Notes

- New ignored test `surfaces_pdf_metadata_and_title` validates the
  contract end-to-end. Run with:
  `cargo test --features pdf -- --ignored
  surfaces_pdf_metadata_and_title` after dropping a PDF with `/Title`
  set into `tests/fixtures/with-metadata.pdf`.
- The metadata API uses pdfium-render 0.9's
  `PdfDocument::metadata()` + `PdfDocumentMetadataTagType`. Dropping
  this in for v0.5.4 (rather than back in v0.2) means we have a
  single API to integrate against — the v0.2-era pdfium-render
  metadata surface had churn that's since settled.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Scanned-PDF → OCR composition.** `PdfiumExtractor` now takes an
  optional OCR fallback at construction via
  `with_ocr_fallback(Box<dyn Extractor>)`. When primary text
  extraction yields empty markdown (the typical signature of an
  image-only scanned PDF), each page is rendered to a temporary PNG
  and routed through the fallback extractor. Per-page output is
  joined with `## Page N` headings so downstream readers — humans and
  LLMs — can cite by page. Fully closes the most-reported gap in
  PdfiumExtractor's v0.2–v0.5.2 surface: scanned PDFs no longer
  silently return empty markdown.
- `Engine::with_defaults` wires the platform OCR backend into
  `PdfiumExtractor` automatically when both `pdf` and `ocr-platform`
  features are enabled and the target OS has a native OCR engine
  (macOS Vision in v0.5.0; Windows.Media.Ocr in v0.5.2). Two OCR
  extractor instances are constructed: one stays in PdfiumExtractor's
  fallback slot for PDFs, the other registers normally for
  PNG/JPG/etc. — both are stateless so duplication is free.
- New public API on `PdfiumExtractor`:
  - `with_ocr_fallback(Box<dyn Extractor>) -> Self` — install the
    fallback (builder-style).
  - `with_ocr_render_scale(f32) -> Self` — override the per-page
    render scale (default 2.0, ~144 DPI). Higher values improve OCR
    accuracy on small text but risk exceeding Windows
    `MaxImageDimension` (~2600 px).
  - `render_pages_to_pngs(path, out_dir) -> Result<Vec<PathBuf>>` —
    render all pages of a PDF to PNG files in `out_dir`. Used
    internally by the OCR-fallback path; exposed publicly so callers
    building richer pipelines can reuse it.
- New extracted-document metadata keys when the OCR fallback fires:
  `extractor_chain` (e.g. `"pdfium-render → vision-macos"`) and
  `pages_ocred` (page count). Stable across the v0.5.x line.

### Changed

- `pdfium-render` feature set now includes `image_latest` (in
  addition to `thread_safe` and `pdfium_latest`). This pulls in the
  `image` crate as a transitive dep for PNG encoding of rendered
  pages — adds ~10 MB compiled to the `pdf` feature, which is the
  acceptable tradeoff for closing the scanned-PDF gap. Callers that
  only want raw text extraction (no OCR fallback) still get the
  smaller v0.5.2 footprint by skipping the `pdf` feature, or by
  constructing `PdfiumExtractor` without an OCR fallback.
- `tempfile = "3"` moves from dev-only to an optional regular dep
  gated by the `pdf` feature, since the OCR-fallback path uses
  `tempfile::tempdir` to spool rendered pages.

### Notes

- The `extract_bytes` path on `PdfiumExtractor` does NOT engage the
  OCR fallback (it would need to spool the byte slice to a tempfile
  first). The file-path API covers the dominant use case. If a real
  caller needs bytes-to-OCR for scanned PDFs, open an issue.
- The mixed-content case (some text-bearing pages, some scanned
  pages within the same PDF) is intentionally NOT handled by the
  v0.5.3 fallback — pdfium returns the text-bearing pages, fallback
  doesn't engage, scanned pages stay missing. Detecting and OCRing
  individual pages within an otherwise text-bearing PDF is left to
  a future release; the trigger today is whole-document
  `markdown.trim().is_empty()`.
- `tests/fixtures/scanned.pdf` end-to-end test added (gated behind
  `#[ignore]`) for local validation. To run on macOS:
  `cargo test --features "pdf ocr-platform" -- --ignored
  scanned_pdf_routes_through_ocr_fallback`.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`WindowsOcrExtractor`** — Windows OCR via the `Windows.Media.Ocr`
  API (the `windows` crate, Microsoft's official windows-rs binding).
  Uses the user's installed profile languages where possible, falls
  back to en-US if no profile language has an OCR pack installed, and
  surfaces a clear typed error pointing the user at *Settings → Time
  & Language → Language → Optional features → OCR* when no language
  pack is OCR-capable.
- Handles standalone image files: PNG, JPG/JPEG, TIFF/TIF, BMP, GIF.
  HEIC/HEIF are intentionally omitted — the Windows imaging stack
  doesn't include them in the base OS, unlike macOS.
- Auto-registration in `Engine::with_defaults` when both the
  `ocr-platform` feature is enabled and the target is Windows.
  Construction is infallible; per-call init may still surface as a
  `ParseError` (no installed OCR language, image too large, STA
  thread, etc.).
- Windows OCR initialisation is per-thread MTA. The first `extract`
  call on a thread runs `RoInitialize(MTA)`; if the thread is locked
  into STA (typical UI/main threads), `extract` returns a typed
  `ParseError` telling the caller to dispatch to a worker thread
  (e.g. `tauri::async_runtime::spawn_blocking`).
- `OcrEngine::MaxImageDimension` is checked up-front. Images
  exceeding the cap (~2600 px on shipping Windows) return
  `ParseError` with a clear message rather than a deep WinRT error.
  Auto-downscale via `BitmapTransform` is planned for a follow-up.

### Notes

- The `windows` crate (`0.62`) is target-conditional and only pulled
  in on Windows. `--features ocr-platform` builds on macOS / Linux
  succeed with no-op behavior on those platforms (Linux gets ONNX
  via `ocr-onnx` in v0.6).
- README "platform-native OCR" line updated to reflect macOS + Windows
  parity for v0.5.2.
- This release was developed on macOS without a Windows host —
  Windows compile-and-test validation happens via CI
  (`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest` matrix builds
  with `cargo test --all-features`).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **`VisionOcrExtractor` returned empty markdown for valid images.**
  v0.5.0 loaded each image via `NSImage::initWithContentsOfURL`, then
  rasterized to a `CGImage` through
  `CGImageForProposedRect_context_hints`, then handed the `CGImage` to
  `VNImageRequestHandler::initWithCGImage_options`. The pipeline ran
  without error, but Vision found zero text observations on every
  input — the multi-step conversion was silently producing a CGImage
  Vision couldn't read. v0.5.1 switches to
  `VNImageRequestHandler::initWithURL_options`, which lets Vision
  load the file directly via Image I/O. Confirmed end-to-end on a
  PNG: Vision now returns the expected text at confidence 1.0.

### Changed

- Dropped the NSImage / CGImage extraction step from
  `src/ocr_macos.rs`. The `objc2-app-kit` and `objc2-core-graphics`
  crates are still pulled in by the `ocr-platform` feature for
  forward compatibility, but the OCR backend itself no longer touches
  either — the `VNImageRequestHandler::initWithURL_options` path goes
  straight from filesystem URL to Vision request.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`VisionOcrExtractor`** — macOS OCR via Apple's Vision framework
  (`VNRecognizeTextRequest`). Neural-network-based, accelerated on
  the Apple Neural Engine on Apple Silicon, handles handwriting and
  mixed languages well, and ships free with every macOS install.
  Gated by the `ocr-platform` feature; only present on macOS targets
  (Windows + Linux are no-ops in v0.5; Windows lands in v0.5.x via
  `Windows.Media.Ocr`, Linux in v0.6 via `ocr-onnx`).
- Handles standalone image files: PNG, JPG/JPEG, TIFF/TIF, BMP, GIF,
  HEIC/HEIF.
- Auto-registration in `Engine::with_defaults` when both the
  `ocr-platform` feature is enabled and the target is macOS.
- Output is one line of markdown per Vision text observation, in
  reading order. Confidence scores and bounding boxes are not
  surfaced today (the `Extractor` trait surface stays simple); a
  future "rich extraction" trait could expose them.
- Runs inside an `autoreleasepool` so autoreleased Cocoa objects get
  cleaned up promptly.

### Changed

- `[lints.rust] unsafe_code` downgraded from `forbid` to `deny`.
  Backends with legitimate FFI needs (the macOS Vision module is
  the first) can now opt in via per-module `#![allow(unsafe_code)]`
  with a clear safety comment. Core dispatch and trait-only
  backends remain unsafe-free.
- Scanned-PDF OCR is **not** wired in v0.5 — `PdfiumExtractor`
  still returns empty markdown for image-only PDFs. A future
  release will detect the empty-result case and route through OCR
  automatically.

### Notes

- `objc2-vision` is already partially safe in v0.6 — most calls to
  Vision APIs don't require `unsafe`. The remaining `unsafe` block
  is for `CGImageForProposedRect_context_hints`, which takes raw
  `*mut NSRect` for the optional out-rect parameter.
- `objc2-vision`, `objc2-app-kit`, `objc2-foundation`, and
  `objc2-core-graphics` are pulled in only on macOS via a target-
  specific dependency block, gated additionally by the
  `ocr-platform` feature. Builds on Windows/Linux with
  `--features ocr-platform` succeed but register no OCR extractor.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`CalamineExtractor`** — XLSX, XLS, XLSB, XLSM, ODS spreadsheet
  extraction via the [`calamine`](https://crates.io/crates/calamine)
  crate (gated by the `calamine` feature). Each worksheet renders as
  a markdown table preceded by an `## ` heading with the sheet name;
  ragged rows pad/truncate to the header column count to keep the
  table well-formed.
- **`CsvExtractor`** — CSV and TSV extraction via the
  [`csv`](https://crates.io/crates/csv) crate (gated by the `csv`
  feature). Auto-selects tab delimiter for `.tsv` files. First row
  treated as the header row; data rendered as a markdown table.
- **`Html2mdExtractor`** — HTML and HTM extraction via the
  [`html2md`](https://crates.io/crates/html2md) crate (gated by the
  `html` feature). Lighter and faster than the Pandoc HTML reader;
  registered before Pandoc in `Engine::with_defaults` so it wins for
  HTML files when both features are enabled.
- All three extractors implement the new pattern: `Default + new()`
  infallible constructors (no runtime dependency to verify), so they
  register unconditionally in `Engine::with_defaults` when their
  feature flag is on.

### Changed

- **Backend registration order in `Engine::with_defaults`** — cheap
  in-process Rust backends (PDF, calamine, csv, html2md) register
  before the Pandoc sidecar, so when format coverage overlaps (HTML
  is the only one today, but future formats may too), the in-process
  backend wins. Documented inline in `src/lib.rs`.
- README + roadmap reflect v0.4 ship.

### Notes

- Pipe characters (`|`) in spreadsheet/CSV cell values are escaped to
  `&#124;` to keep markdown tables well-formed; embedded newlines
  collapse to a single space for the same reason.
- The `csv` crate is referenced via `::csv::` in `src/csv.rs` to
  disambiguate from the local module of the same name. Module name
  matches the feature name for consistency with the other backends.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`PandocExtractor`** for DOCX, PPTX, EPUB, RTF, ODT, LaTeX (`tex`,
  `latex`), and HTML (`html`, `htm`). Spawns the `pandoc` binary per
  file with a stdin/stdout protocol; outputs GitHub-Flavored Markdown
  (`gfm`). Gated by the `pandoc` feature.
- **`PandocExtractor::new`** locates `pandoc` on the system PATH and
  verifies it responds to `--version` before declaring success.
- **`PandocExtractor::with_binary`** uses an explicit binary path —
  preferred when shipping a static `pandoc` binary alongside your
  application (Tauri / Iced / similar).
- **`PandocExtractor::pandoc_from`** (associated function) maps file
  extensions to Pandoc reader names; exposed publicly so callers can
  pre-check whether a given file is supported.
- Auto-registration in `Engine::with_defaults()` when the `pandoc`
  feature is enabled. Falls back gracefully (logs via
  `with_defaults_diagnostic`, silently skips otherwise) when the
  pandoc binary isn't found.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — retroactive entries for v0.1.0 and
  v0.2.0 included for completeness.

### Changed

- README roadmap reflects v0.3 ship.

### Notes

- No persistent server mode yet (each `extract` call spawns a fresh
  `pandoc` process — ~50ms cold-start). Pandoc's `--server` mode
  amortizes that across calls; will land as an opt-in optimization
  in a later release.
- No PDF input via Pandoc by design — Pandoc deliberately doesn't
  read PDFs; mdkit's `Engine` dispatches PDF to the `pdf` backend
  (`PdfiumExtractor`) automatically when both features are enabled.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`PdfiumExtractor`** for PDF text extraction via Google's Pdfium
  engine through the `pdfium-render` crate (gated by the `pdf`
  feature). In-process, layout-aware, no sidecar.
- **`PdfiumExtractor::new`** binds to libpdfium on the system library
  path; **`PdfiumExtractor::with_library_path`** binds from an
  explicit directory (Tauri-style "ship libpdfium next to the
  binary"). Both return `Error::MissingDependency` when libpdfium
  isn't found.
- **`Engine::with_defaults_diagnostic`** — new method alongside
  `Engine::with_defaults` that returns the engine plus a list of
  `(backend_name, Error)` for each backend that failed to register.
  Lets callers log "PDF support disabled: libpdfium not found"
  rather than silently shipping a degraded experience.
- Auto-registration of the PDF extractor in `Engine::with_defaults()`
  when libpdfium is available; engine still constructs successfully
  when libpdfium is missing (the PDF extractor is just absent).

### Changed

- `pdfium-render` dependency configured with `default-features =
  false` and only the `thread_safe` + `pdfium_latest` features —
  avoids pulling in the `image` crate weight since mdkit doesn't
  render PDF pages, only extracts text.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- Initial release. Establishes the crate name on crates.io and the
  public API surface that backends will target.
- **`Engine`** — the dispatcher. Routes `extract(path)` calls to the
  registered `Extractor` for the file's extension.
- **`Extractor` trait** — the per-format integration point.
  Implementors declare `extensions()`, `name()`, `extract(path)`,
  and optionally `extract_bytes(bytes, ext)`.
- **`Document`** — the unit of output. `markdown` is always present;
  `title` and `metadata` are best-effort and may be empty.
- **Typed `Error` enum** — `Io`, `UnsupportedFormat`,
  `UnsupportedOperation`, `ParseError`, `MissingDependency`,
  `SidecarFailure`, `Other`. Coarse-grained on purpose; backends
  distinguished via `Extractor::name` when needed.
- **Feature flags pre-declared** (no-op placeholders so the public
  feature surface is stable from v0.1): `pdf`, `pandoc`,
  `ocr-platform`, `ocr-onnx`, `calamine`, `csv`, `html`, `full`,
  `default = ["pdf", "calamine", "csv", "html"]`.
- Dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0 (Rust ecosystem convention).
- CI workflow on Ubuntu + macOS + Windows (stable Rust + MSRV 1.75
  + clippy + rustfmt + cargo-audit gates).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` for repo hygiene.
